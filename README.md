# Schedule-It
This folder contains several different snippets of code and screen shots from a few of the tickets I worked on during my internship at Prosper IT.
It was an ASP.net MVC C# projecct using entity framework and a code first database through SQL server. It was a user management system that was being developed and I worked on quality testing, identifying bugs, fixing bugs and adding new functinoality to the web app.
